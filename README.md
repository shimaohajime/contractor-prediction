# The Use of AI in Legal Systems: Determining Independent Contractor vs. Employee Status

This is a repository for the contractor-employy prediction project by Cohen et al. The project summary can be found at https://myopencourt.org/. The draft of the first paper is available at https://XXX.

## Contractor vs employee prediction in Canadian cases
To reproduce the results regarding the Canadian cases, first run *data_cleaning.py*, then *predictions.py*. The analysis about the deployment at MyOpenCourt is performed in *analyses_deployment.py*. Note that we are planning to release our datasets as soon as the paper is accepted.

## Transfer learning with US cases
We are currently extending our project to cover the cases in the United States. This part of the analyses, *data_cleaning_US.py* and *analyses_US.py*, is under development.
